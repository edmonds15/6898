# 6898
### A web application for the Edmonds School District 6898 emergency phone service.

This application was created using ASP.net in Microsoft Visual Studio to record and quickly notify admins of school-related incidents.
It also uses [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) in JavaScript, and [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/) and [UI Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) in styling.
Note that these are reference files, and will not work by themselves.
You can find the published version [here](http://infosysapps.edmonds.wednet.edu/6898) when connected to our server.
Thank you.
